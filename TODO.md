# TODO

* [X ] Implement some sort of AI.  I'm more for the [utility-based version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_system), let's see what happens.
* [X ] Add creature-parsing via JSON.  I use [this JSON Implementation](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) of the Java API specification.  Looks neat!
* [ ] Implement [Kruskals](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/3/maze-generation-kruskal-s-algorithm) for Maze Generation?  
* [ ] Fix that damned Dijkstra.  I'm still not sure why I should keep that around - ahem, [heatmaps maybe](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22848888)?
* [ ] A better text parser (Not a priority)
* [X ] Refactor the codebase - No Way...
* [ ] Documentation, documentation!
* [ ] Add more background, a story and some content to the game.
* [ ] Add [Localization](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/intro/index.html) .
* [ ] IDK just get on with life eventually.
