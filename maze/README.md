# METRO


## What?


This is an **attempt** at building a - hopefully performant - rogue-like game, inspired by the novel [Metro]() from the Russian author []().

## How?

I use the ECS system to manage actors and items.  The plan is to build a robust and - highly - configurable game, in which the creatures can be easily defined.  It should be possible to play as different races, including human, different specified genders etc etc.

## Motive?

School project :))

Okay, but it was supposed to be that.  And then I realized what have I signed myself up for.  I'm not even sure if I can incorporate all of the features I promised in the document plan.

## How to Play?

    Eventually one has to write a better interface to the world (I'm blind and have settled for an [Interactive Fiction-Style-ish]() TUI, but I tried to keep the systems as much decoupled as I could, so adding more views should not be that all clunky, right?

    A list of different commands is obtained by typing "help, Help, h or H" - whatever it pleases.

  The "look/Look/l/L" should provide you with a descriptive view of your surrounding.

    "Show map" will dump the whole world to the console (for testing purposes only!).  Though the grid is probably shown in a badly manner - this is because I'm too dum to navigate propperly ASCII-Maps with a Braille  Display.


## What Else?

    There's a list of [TODO](), and [Code Documentation](  ) in German.  The latter is unfortunately compolcery to write!

## Credits/Curtacy

Here's a list of [Article References](  ) I used/am currently using to add features.  

I'm really thankful for the folks at [Roguebasin](   ), [the Guy on Github](   ), [Eric Lippert](   ), [Adam  ](   ), [Bob    ](     )
for the decent amount of materials they posted online! <3
